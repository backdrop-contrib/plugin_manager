Plugin API
=============

Provides tools and APIs for Plugins -- tools to make it easy for modules to let
other modules implement plugins from .inc files.

The plugins tool allows a module to allow *other* modules (and themes!) to
provide plugins which provide some kind of functionality or some kind of task.
For example, in Panels there are several types of plugins: Content types (which
are like blocks), layouts (which are page layouts) and styles (which can be used
to style a panel). Each plugin is represented by a .inc file, and the
functionality they offer can differ wildly.

A module which uses plugins can implement a hook describing the plugin (which is
not necessary, as defaults will be filled in) and then calls a ctools function
which loads either all the known plugins (used for listing/choosing) or a
specific plugin (used when it's known which plugin is needed). From the
perspective of the plugin system, a plugin is a packet of data, usually some
printable info and a list of callbacks. It is up to the module implementing
plugins to determine what that info means and what the callbacks do.

A module which implements plugins must first implement the
`hook_plugin_directory` function, which simply tells the system
which plugins are supported and what directory to look in. Each plugin will then
be in a separate .inc file in the directory supplied. The .inc file will contain
a specially named hook which returns the data necessary to implement the plugin.
